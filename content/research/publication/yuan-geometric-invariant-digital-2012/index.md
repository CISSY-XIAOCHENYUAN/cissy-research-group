abstract: "A robust and geometric invariant digital image watermarking scheme based on robust feature points detector and local Zernike transform is proposed in this paper. The robust feature points detector is proposed based on SIFT algorithm to extract circular patches. A local Zernike moments-based watermarking scheme is raised. Each extracted circular patch is decomposed into a collection of binary patches and Zernike transform is applied to the appointed binary patches. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme is very robust against geometric distortions and common signal processing."
