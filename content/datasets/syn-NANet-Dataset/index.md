title: NANet Dateset for Splicing

summary: The NANet Dataset is a synthetic dataset specifically designed for splicing forgery detection, using the MSCOCO datasets as its foundational sources. There are 113,964 forgery images in NANet. In this dataset, the positively labeled instances correspond to tampered regions, whereas the negatively labeled instances pertain to non-tampered regions. A pair of positive and negative region belongs to the same category to ensures a reasonable semantic relevance of tampered images within the NANet dataset. [DOWNLOAD HERE](https://markdown.com.cn).
