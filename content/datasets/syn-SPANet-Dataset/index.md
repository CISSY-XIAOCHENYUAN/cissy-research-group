title: SPANet Dataset for Copy-Move

summary: The SPANet Dataset is a synthetic dataset specifically designed for copy-move forgery detection, using the SUN and MSCOCO datasets as its foundational sources. The dataset consists of 550 basic forgery images, including a diverse range of **12 attack types** within rotation and scaling variations, and **11 post-processing techniques**. Therefore, the number of forgery images in SPANet Dataset is 550 * 12 * 11 = **72600**. [DOWNLOAD HERE]({{< ref "../wait.md" >}}).
