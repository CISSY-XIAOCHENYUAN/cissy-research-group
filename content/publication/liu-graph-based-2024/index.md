abstract: 'Many countries across the globe face the serious issue of traffic congestion.
  This paper presents a low-cost graph-based traffic forecasting and congestion detection
  framework using online images from multiple cameras. The advantage of using a graph
  neural network (GNN) for traffic forecasting and detection is that it represents
  the traffic network in a natural way. This framework requires only images from surveillance
  cameras without any other sensors. It converts the online images into two types
  of data: traffic volume and image-based traffic occupancy. A clustering-based graph
  construction method is proposed to build a graph based on the traffic network. For
  traffic forecasting, multiple models, including statistical models and deep graph
  convolutional neural networks (GCNs), are used and compared using the extracted
  data. The framework uses logistic regression to determine the threshold of traffic
  congestion. In the experiment, we found that the Decoupled Dynamic Spatial-Temporal
  Graph Neural Network (D2STGNN) model achieved the best performance on the collected
  dataset. We also propose a threshold-based method for detecting traffic congestion
  using traffic volume and image-based traffic occupancy. This framework provides
  a low-cost solution for traffic forecasting and congestion detection when only surveillance
  images are available.'
