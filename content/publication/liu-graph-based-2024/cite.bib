 abstract = {Many countries across the globe face the serious issue of traffic congestion. This paper presents a low-cost graph-based traffic forecasting and congestion detection framework using online images from multiple cameras. The advantage of using a graph neural network (GNN) for traffic forecasting and detection is that it represents the traffic network in a natural way. This framework requires only images from surveillance cameras without any other sensors. It converts the online images into two types of data: traffic volume and image-based traffic occupancy. A clustering-based graph construction method is proposed to build a graph based on the traffic network. For traffic forecasting, multiple models, including statistical models and deep graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs), are used and compared using the extracted data. The framework uses logistic regression to determine the threshold of traffic congestion. In the experiment, we found that the Decoupled Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Network (D2STGNN) model achieved the best performance on the collected dataset. We also propose a threshold-based method for detecting traffic congestion using traffic volume and image-based traffic occupancy. This framework provides a low-cost solution for traffic forecasting and congestion detection when only surveillance images are available.},
