abstract: "This paper proposes an adaptive over-segmentation
meth-od for image copy-move forgery detection. Firstly, the
Adaptive Over-Segmentation algorithm is proposed to adaptively
segment the host image into non-overlapping and irregular
blocks. Then the feature points are extracted and matched with
each other to locate the labeled feature points which can
approximately indicate the suspected forgery regions. Finally the
labeled feature points are processed and the morphological
operation is applied to generate the detected forgery regions.
Experimental results indicate the good performance of the
proposed copy-move forgery detection."
