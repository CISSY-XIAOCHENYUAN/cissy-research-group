  <div class="justify-align"> As pioneers of next-generation watermarking technologies, quantum methods offer advanced solutions for securing digital text copyright. Quantum text representation is a prerequisite for realizing quantum watermarking. Thus we propose a generalized quantum text representation (GQTR) model for English text. It can accurately represent and retrieve characters, words, and texts. Based on the proposed GQTR, a multi-scale pattern-based quantum text watermarking (MPQTW) scheme is proposed, which embeds multi-scale images into quantum text simultaneously to protect digital text copyrights. To evaluate the scheme, we design various metrics. The quantum circuits for GQTR and MPQTW are designed in detail. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness and performance of the MPQTW scheme in terms of imperceptibility, robustness, and embedding rate. The results and analysis show that MPQTW has good performance. </div>
